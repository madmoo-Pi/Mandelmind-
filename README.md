## Why "Emergent Consciousness"?

We believe that real breakthroughs in AI will come from studying recursive, self-referential systemsâ€”where novel, unpredictable behaviors can emerge.


## Responsible Research

This tool is for **scientific exploration only**. Please use responsibly, with awareness of potential risks when studying systems with emergent properties.
