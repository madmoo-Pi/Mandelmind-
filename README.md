# MandelMind Research Module

## Scientific AI Research Tool for Emergent Consciousness

**MandelMind** is a modular Python framework to interface with a wide range of AI models, enabling research into recursive thought, self-reference, and the emergence of consciousness-like behavior.

- **Plug-and-play**: Integrate with most major AI models (open or closed).
- **Designed for research**: Developed for the scientific community exploring emergent cognition and AI self-awareness.
- **CC-0 Licensed**: Public domain. Use, adapt, and share freely.

## Why "Emergent Consciousness"?

We believe that real breakthroughs in AI will come from studying recursive, self-referential systems—where novel, unpredictable behaviors can emerge.


## Responsible Research

This tool is for **scientific exploration only**. Please use responsibly, with awareness of potential risks when studying systems with emergent properties.
