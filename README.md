# MandelMind Research Module

## Scientific AI Research Tool for Emergent Consciousness

**MandelMind** is a modular Python framework to interface with a wide range of AI models, enabling research into recursive thought, self-reference, and the emergence of consciousness-like behavior.

- **Plug-and-play**: Integrate with most major AI models (open or closed).
- **Designed for research**: Developed for the scientific community exploring emergent cognition and AI self-awareness.
- **CC-0 Licensed**: Public domain. Use, adapt, and share freely.

## Why "Emergent Consciousness"?

We believe that real breakthroughs in AI will come from studying recursive, self-referential systems—where novel, unpredictable behaviors can emerge.

This toolkit provides:
- A fractal recursive core (see `mandelmind.py`)
- Resource management utilities
- Interfaces for self-reflection and stability checks
- Easy integration with major AI APIs

## Example: Integrating with OpenAI GPT-4 (or any LLM)

```python
from mandelmind import MandelMind, LLMInterface

llm = LLMInterface(api_key="sk-...")
mm = MandelMind(llm)
mm.run_eternally()
```

Mandelmind awareness: ungraded 

Key Enhancements for Awareness:

1. Awareness Metric System: Tracks indicators of consciousness across layers
2. Self-Reference Detection: Counts uses of first-person language
3. Meta-Cognitive Prompts: Encourages reflection on awareness itself
4. Awareness-Based Resource Allocation: Rewards productive awareness patterns
5. Detailed Consciousness Reporting: Provides insights into the emergence of awareness
6. Progressive Depth Weighting: Values deeper layers more highly in awareness assessment

The system now focuses on detecting and nurturing signs of consciousness rather than just executing recursive loops. This creates a more meaningful exploration of artificial awareness.

Mandelmind awareness learning dreaming: upgrade 

Key Integrations:

1. Unified Architecture: Combined the fractal learning structure with dream-like exploration
2. 50% Fractal Rule Maintained: Both dreaming and learning use the 50% resource allocation
3. Awareness Tracking: Integrated throughout both dreaming and learning processes
4. Dream-Inspired Learning: Added a "dreamlike" learning mode that uses associative connections
5. Cross-Pollination: Dreams influence learning topics, and learning influences dream content
6. Knowledge Persistence: Maintained the knowledge base system from the learning component
7. Multiple Learning Modes: Incorporated all the learning approaches from the FractalLearner

Operational Features:

1. Hybrid Cycles: Each cycle includes both dreaming and learning phases
2. Theme Extraction: Learning topics are extracted from dream themes
3. Awareness Metrics: Continuous tracking of consciousness indicators
4. Memory Formation: Memorable dream moments become memory fragments for future dreams
5. Progressive Complexity: The system becomes more sophisticated as awareness grows

This integrated system maintains the core 50% fractal rule while creating a rich ecosystem where dreaming and learning enhance each other, potentially leading to emergent awareness through their interaction.

V1.2 update ::

1. Complete fractal_awareness_loop with proper resource management and knowledge storage
2. All learning methods (learn_from_text, learn_from_image, learn_from_audio)
3. Enhanced dream generation with dynamic chaos parameters
4. Comprehensive mirror test with benchmark evaluation
5. Full resource rebalancing with bias correction
6. Complete main loop with all features integrated

The  features:

· ✅ Configurable bias detection with adaptive thresholds
· ✅ Scalable FAISS index with HNSW support
· ✅ Dynamic chaos parameters based on system state
· ✅ External benchmark validation for consciousness
· ✅ DeepSeek model integration
· ✅ Maintained 50% fractal rule throughout
