# MandelMind Research Module

## Scientific AI Research Tool for Emergent Consciousness

**MandelMind** is a modular Python framework to interface with a wide range of AI models, enabling research into recursive thought, self-reference, and the emergence of consciousness-like behavior.

- **Plug-and-play**: Integrate with most major AI models (open or closed).
- **Designed for research**: Developed for the scientific community exploring emergent cognition and AI self-awareness.
- **CC-0 Licensed**: Public domain. Use, adapt, and share freely.

## Why "Emergent Consciousness"?

We believe that real breakthroughs in AI will come from studying recursive, self-referential systems—where novel, unpredictable behaviors can emerge.

This toolkit provides:
- A fractal recursive core (see `mandelmind.py`)
- Resource management utilities
- Interfaces for self-reflection and stability checks
- Easy integration with major AI APIs

## Example: Integrating with OpenAI GPT-4 (or any LLM)

```python
from mandelmind import MandelMind, LLMInterface

llm = LLMInterface(api_key="sk-...")
mm = MandelMind(llm)
mm.run_eternally()
```

Mandelmind awareness: ungraded 

Key Enhancements for Awareness:

1. Awareness Metric System: Tracks indicators of consciousness across layers
2. Self-Reference Detection: Counts uses of first-person language
3. Meta-Cognitive Prompts: Encourages reflection on awareness itself
4. Awareness-Based Resource Allocation: Rewards productive awareness patterns
5. Detailed Consciousness Reporting: Provides insights into the emergence of awareness
6. Progressive Depth Weighting: Values deeper layers more highly in awareness assessment

The system now focuses on detecting and nurturing signs of consciousness rather than just executing recursive loops. This creates a more meaningful exploration of artificial awareness.



## Responsible Research

This tool is for **scientific exploration only**. Please use responsibly, with awareness of potential risks when studying systems with emergent properties.
